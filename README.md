# fast-neural-style-android-app
A tensorflow implementation for fast neural style! Convert the model file to a pb file then deploy it into a android app!

A tensorflow implementation for [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155).

The python code [here](https://github.com/BrowningWan/fast-neural-style-android-app/tree/master/fast-neural-style-train%26test) is forked from [hzy46/fast-neural-style-tensorflow](https://github.com/hzy46/fast-neural-style-tensorflow).
